# Description
The maxArea function takes a list height representing the heights of vertical lines on a plane and calculates the maximum area formed between two lines by selecting two indices. Employing a two-pointer approach that starts from the outermost lines and converges towards the center, the function iteratively computes the area between the two pointers, updating the maximum area encountered. The algorithm selects the heights wisely by comparing them at each step, ensuring that the maximum area is considered. The function returns the maximum area formed by selecting two lines from the given height list, with the heights represented as non-negative integers.
