# Description
The two_sum function takes a list of integers (nums) and a target sum (target) as parameters. It aims to find a pair of numbers in the list whose sum equals the target. Utilizing a dictionary to store the indices of numbers while iterating through the list, the function calculates the complement for each number and checks if it is present in the dictionary. If a matching complement is found, the function returns a list containing the indices of the two numbers. In cases where no such pair is identified, the function returns None. This implementation ensures an efficient search for the desired sum within the given list of integers.
